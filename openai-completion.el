Arguments PROMPT and CALLBACK are required for this type of request. PROMPT is
either the question or instruction to OpenAI.  CALLBACK is the execuation after
request is made.

Arguments KEY and USER are global options; however, you can overwrite the value
by passing it in.

The rest of the arugments are optional, please see OpenAI API reference page
for more information.  Arguments here refer to MODEL, SUFFIX, MAX-TOKENS,
TEMPERATURE, TOP-P, N, STREAM, LOGPROBS, ECHO, STOP, PRESENCE-PENALTY,
