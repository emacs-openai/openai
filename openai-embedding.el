INPUT text to get embeddings for, encoded as a string or array of tokens.
To get embeddings for multiple inputs in a single request, pass an array of
strings or array of token arrays.  Each input must not exceed 8192 tokens in
length.

The argument CALLBACK is execuated after request is made.

Arguments CONTENT-TYPE, KEY, ORG-ID and USER are global options; however, you
can overwrite the value by passing it in.

The rest of the arugments are optional, please see OpenAI API reference page
for more information.  Arguments here refer to MODEL."
